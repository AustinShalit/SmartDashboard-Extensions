## WPILib Mission

The WPILib Mission is to enable FIRST teams to focus on writing game-specific software rather than on hardware details - "raise the floor, don't lower the ceiling". We try to enable teams with limited programming knowledge and/or mentor experience to do as much as possible, while not hampering the abilities of teams with more advanced programming capabilities. We support Kit of Parts control system components directly in the library. We also strive to keep parity between major features of each language (Java, C++, and NI's LabVIEW), so that teams aren't at a disadvantage for choosing a specific programming language. WPILib is an open-source project, licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. You can find a copy of the license [here](BSD_License_for_WPILib_code.txt).

## Requirements
- [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Building

Use `./gradlew jar` to build.  To copy into the SmartDashboard extensions directory use `./gradlew copy`.
